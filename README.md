## About Me

I’m a software-focused engineer with experience building and validating real-time systems in safety-critical environments. My background spans robotics, distributed systems, and performance engineering, with an emphasis on correctness, determinism, and maintainability.

I currently work in robotic surgical systems, where I develop tooling and infrastructure for simulation, verification, and system-level testing. My academic work deepens this focus through systems programming, computer architecture, and distributed systems coursework.
